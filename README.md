Final Project C0deAmya is a website that will be able to create accounts and save a persons coding progress. It also tracks the times you sign in and sign out.
Now because you can't completely integrate coding a website with c++, this project required me to implement things such as Pthyon and javascript.
Since I did Python last semester i am quite familiar with how to navigate it but Javascript was a bit of a challenge to understand.
I knew that this would take a lot of time so I did a lot of time prepping so to ensure that the code works I put it through another website (programiz)
This is going to be an example code(s) that I will be implementing into the actual web page once I've worked out the possibility of potential bugs.
I hope that this Project not only show my ablities in coding but also a way of improvement as well. Thank you!
